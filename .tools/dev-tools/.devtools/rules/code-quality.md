# Code Quality Standards

- TypeScript strict mode required
- No `any` types without JSDoc justification
- 80%+ test coverage for new features
- All functions must have return type annotations
- Use conventional commits: feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Minimize comments by making code self-documenting
