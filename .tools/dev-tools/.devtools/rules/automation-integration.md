# Automation Integration

- Use existing scripts in `.automation/scripts/`
- Respect git hooks (skip only in emergencies with SKIP_HOOKS=1)
- Run health-check.sh before major changes
- Use fix-all.sh for automated fixes
- Leverage turbo tasks for builds/tests
- Follow conventional commit format
- Maintain automation infrastructure patterns
