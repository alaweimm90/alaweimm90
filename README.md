*I build simulation frameworks to control misbehaving electrons, bend new materials to my will, and prototype smart quantum systems — just smart enough to accelerate physics, but not smart enough to start a robot uprising. Yet. 🧠🤖*

## ⚛️ Some Research Topics

- **Quantum Properties of Rippled 2D Materials:** Flat-band formation in monolayer TMDs and its consequences: quantum wells, exciton traps, and platforms for Mott insulators, superconductivity, and possibly weird correlated stuff we haven’t named yet.  
- **Multiscale Simulation Frameworks:** DFT + MD hybrids using `SIESTA`, `LAMMPS`, `ASE`, and `SLURM`, glued together with Python and duct tape (a.k.a. [`QMatSim`](https://github.com/alaweimm90/QMatSim)).  
- **Quantum Device Modeling & Spintronics:** Circuit-level simulations for spin-orbitronics, multistate logic, and magnonic wizardry (all mostly via [`SpinCirc`](https://github.com/alaweimm90/SpinCirc) and [`MagLogic`](https://github.com/alaweimm90/MagLogic)).  
- **Quantum SDKs & Variational Algorithms:** Hacking together variational pipelines using `Qiskit`, `Cirq`, and VQE to turn Hamiltonians into headaches (and maybe insights).  
- **Materials Informatics & Structure Databases:** CIFs, JSONs, and regret. Automating property predictions and structure curation with `pymatgen`, structure graphs, and data-fueled optimism.  
- **Band Structure & Electronic Modeling:** Custom tight-binding models, band flattening, Rashba hunting, and effective mass whispering in low-dimensional quantum zoos.

## 🧪 Current Playgrounds

- 🧠 **Graph-Based Quantum Simulation:** Playing with graph topologies as if they were LEGO sets for tight-binding models.  
- 🤖 **Scientific ML for Materials:** GNNs, PINNs, and surrogate DFT — for when I want neural nets to approximate physics (and occasionally hallucinate).  
- 🎓 [**QubeML**](https://github.com/alaweimm90/QubeML): An educational repo for learning quantum computing + materials informatics.  
  *Come play with me. Colab notebooks, clean code, and a zero-judgment zone for getting stuck.* 🤝

Explore the tools I build when I should be sleeping (none on this platform does anyway):

- 📘 [**QubeML**](https://github.com/alaweimm90/QubeML): An educational framework for quantum computing + materials informatics in Python/Colab.  
  - Hands-on Jupyter/Colab notebooks  
  - From quantum gates to DFT and ML  
  - Great for students, researchers, and curious insomniacs  
  - Constantly updated = we learn together (or both get stuck) 🤝

- 🔷 [**QMatSim**](https://github.com/alaweimm90/QMatSim): DFT + MD pipeline for high-throughput strain–structure screening and flat-band treasure hunting.

- 🧮 [**SciComp**](https://github.com/alaweimm90/SciComp): Multilingual toolbox for quantum, FEM, statistical, and spintronic simulations (aka physics in multiple dialects).

- 🌀 [**SpinCirc**](https://github.com/alaweimm90/SpinCirc): SPICE-compatible simulator for multistate spintronic logic and not-yet-obsolete device concepts.

- 🧲 [**MagLogic**](https://github.com/alaweimm90/MagLogic): Modeling toolkit for nanomagnetic logic, SOT dynamics, and other spin-based mischief.

- 🌐 [**SimCore**](https://simcore.dev): Browser-based platform for quantum systems, Berry curvature, ML-injected physics, and interactive demos. Comes with pretty plots and buttons that still don't work.
