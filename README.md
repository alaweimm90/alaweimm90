# 🧪 Meshal Alawein - Computational physicist working at the intersection of quantum materials, device physics, and scientific computing

I build simulation frameworks to control misbehaving electrons, play with new materials, and prototype smart quantum systems — just smart enough to accelerate physics, but not smart enough to start a robot uprising. 🧠⚛️🤖

## 🧠 Some Research Topics & Fun Emerging Directions

- **Quantum Properties of Rippled 2D Materials:** Flat-band formation in monolayer TMDs and its consequences: quantum wells, exciton traps, and candidate platforms for Mott insulators, superconductivity, and correlated phases  
- **Multiscale Simulation Frameworks:** Hybrid DFT + MD pipelines using `SIESTA`, `LAMMPS`, `ASE`, and `SLURM`, with automated convergence, error handling, and high-throughput screening via [`QMatSim`](https://github.com/alaweimm90/QMatSim)  
- **Quantum Device Modeling & Spintronics:** Circuit-level simulators for spintronic/spin-orbitronic devices via [`SpinCirc`](https://github.com/alaweimm90/SpinCirc), nanomagnetic logic frameworks via [`MagLogic`](https://github.com/alaweimm90/MagLogic), and early-stage modeling of AFM spintronics and magnonics  
- **Quantum SDKs & Variational Algorithms:** Developing variational pipelines using `Qiskit`, `Cirq`, and VQE for Hamiltonian modeling and materials-inspired quantum workflows  
- **Materials Informatics & Structure Databases:** Structure parsing and workflow integration with tools like `pymatgen`, CIF I/O, and automated pipelines for property prediction and structure curation  
- **Band Structure Theory & Electronic Modeling:** Building custom tight-binding models, flattening dispersions, extracting localization lengths, quantifying Rashba spin-splitting, and mapping anisotropic effective masses in low-dimensional systems

## 🧪 Current Playgrounds & Learning Frontiers

- **Graph-Based Quantum Simulation:** Exploring custom graph topologies for quantum emulation and tight-binding approximations  
- **Scientific ML for Materials:** PINNs, GNNs, surrogate DFT/MD models (this, just for fun, for now)
